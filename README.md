# Linked-List
## AIM
To store information and display a linked list 

## Theory
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
1) data
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node
Linked list is of three type
1. Linear Linked List
2. Doubly linked list
3. Circular Linked list

## Algorithm




## Conclusion
Linked list follows dyna,ic memory allocation i.e memory allocation happens in run time
